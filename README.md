# Assignment-1
Git practice

This project has been created and editing on Visual Studios and psuh remotely to this repository.

It runs a player (user) versus dealer (program) simulation of the game 7 1/2.
The player starts out with $100 and can bet and play until they run out of money, or the dealer has lost a total of $900.

I began with some code provided by the professor and pushed only waht was given.

Next, I completed the Card class and functions.

My next commit was the basic functions and declarations for the Player and Hand classes.
    These will probably need more work and be added to later.
  
I created README.md file on GitHub, not visual studios, so I ran into a little trouble since it was not created on Visual Studios first. 
    I thought I had to merge the two, but it turns out I had to sync the repositories by pulling READM.md from GitHub.
    
As expected, I had to go back and add two member functions to the Card and Hand classes, print_card and print_hand respectively.

Creating the run_game funciton was a huge commit step in my project. This funciton brought most of my code together to run the game.

I then began to work in an experimental branch "fout" to create the function game_log which would output information to a .txt file. 
    To avoid a fast forward, I also worked in master branch in the main function.
    
I contiuned working in both fout and master, updating README.md and synching it with the GitHub repository, and then when I finished,
    I merged the fout into the master branch, to implement the successful changes to my project.
