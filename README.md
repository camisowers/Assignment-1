Git practice

This project has been created and editing on Visual Studios and psuh remotely to this repository.

It runs a player (user) versus dealer (program) simulation of the game 7 1/2.
The player starts out with $100 and can bet and play until they run out of money, or the dealer has lost a total of $900.

I began with some code provided by the professor and pushed only waht was given.

Next, I completed the Card class and functions.

My next commit was the basic functions and declarations for the Player and Hand classes.
    These will probably need more work and be added to later.
